LLM â‰  GenAI Workflows â‰  GenAI Agents â‰  Agentic AI

These are not the same thing â€” and knowing the difference helps us pick the right AI for the job.

ðŸ”¹ LLM â€“ The raw capability: predicts, summarises, translates. Think of it as the engine.

Use cases: Simple, single-step language tasks (summarisation, translation, sentiment analysis, Q&A).
Example: Asking ChatGPT to summarise an article.
â¸»

ðŸ”¹ GenAI Workflow â€“ Structured process using LLMs (and maybe other AI tools) for a defined, repeatable task. Think of it as the machine around the engine.

Use cases: Document review, automated content generation, customer support flows, compliance checks.
Example: Document â†’ extract clauses â†’ check compliance â†’ summarise.

ðŸ”¹ GenAI Agent â€“ LLM that uses tools/APIs to act on your behalf within set boundaries. Think of it as a skilled assistant.

Use cases: Sales assistance, ticket resolution, data fetching & updating, API-triggered workflows.
Example: Queries CRM â†’ drafts email â†’ logs interaction.

ðŸ”¹ Agentic AI â€“ Autonomous system that plans, reasons, and acts over multiple steps with minimal human input. Think of it as an independent problem-solver.

Use cases: Market monitoring, end-to-end process automation, adaptive decision-making, multi-agent collaboration.
Example: Researches market â†’ adjusts pricing â†’ triggers supply chain changes.

ðŸ’¡ Key takeaway: Not every problem needs an Agent, and not every Agent needs to be fully Agentic. Choose the right AI building block for the problem at hand.
